1. [Scipy](http://scipy.org/) :Scipy for scientific python
1. [Scikit-image](http://scikit-image.org/): Scikit-image is a package for image processing
1. [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) Scikit-learn is for all machine learning operations
1. [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) Matplotlib is a 2D plotting library for python

## How to Install

1. Clone this Repository
2. Go to the extracted folder
3. Install all the necessary dependencies by using
<b>`pip install -r requirements.txt`</b>

## How to Run

#### For a better undestaing what's going on with these scripts follow this order

1. `python3 localization.py` With this you can change the images in test folder and changing the line 
`car_image = imread("test\car1.jpg", as_grey=True)`
with your own name. Functionality of this scipt is greyscale the picture given

2. `python3 cca2.py` This script imports the previous one for getting the greyscale image. So this will open another window with previous result which can be commented if you don't need that

3. `python3 segmentation.py` Number plate detection is made manually here. 
`license_plate = np.invert(cca2.plate_like_objects[2])`
However if the license plate is not detected you will have to change this index 2 to the licenseplate box number

4. `python3 machine_train.py` Training process with data in the train folder is done with this script.

5. `python3 prediction.py` Given image's (car1.jpg) License plate number will be visible in the terminal output in here
